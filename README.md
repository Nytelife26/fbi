FBI is a reconnaisance utility for Facebook accounts (disclaimer: only works on users you are friends with currently). Sensitive information that would otherwise be unavailable can easily be found even if the target has their privacy settings tightened, potentially including residence, date of birth, occupation, phone number and email address.


**DISCLAIMER:** I do not condone using this script to stalk people, but rather recommend using it to check your own account for privacy holes, or an account owned by someone that has given you explicit consent.
